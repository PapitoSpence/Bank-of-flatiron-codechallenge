## Setup

1. Clone the repository

To clone the repository run git clone from your terminal,using this link
    
        git@github.com:PapitoSpence/Bank-of-flatiron-codechallenge.git

2. After cloning navigate to the cloned repository using 

            cd Bank-of-flatiron-codechallenge

3. In a new terminal, run `npm start`. This will run your React app on port `3000`.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

- See a table of the transactions.
- Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add the new
  transaction to the table **as well as post the new transaction to the backend
  API for persistence**.
- Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
  description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions
  table.
